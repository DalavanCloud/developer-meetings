# (example) Session: Switch to Base32 and the Handling of CIDv0

**Description:**

Issue "Make base32 CIDv1 the default for go-ipfs is stalled" (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4143) in go-ipfs is stalled.  I am not sure the reason but I think part of it is the how to handle CIDv0 (https://github.com/ipfs/go-cid/issues/34).

Having all key players in the same room would be an ideal opportunity to move this forward and work though and outstanding issues.

**Activity:** Make decisions on if we want to switch to base32 and would though how CIDv0 will be handled.

**Goal(s):**
Resolving outstanding issues so we can move forward.

**Duration:** 30 maybe 60 minutes, however long it takes to consider the issue carefully.

**Participation:** Core develops and key stakeholders.
