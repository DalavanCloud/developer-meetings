# Session: Switch to Base32 and the Handling of CIDv0

- **Proposed by:** @kevina
- **Led by:** possibly @kevina
- **Duration:** 30 maybe 60 minutes, however long it takes to consider the issue carefully.
- **Who has to be there in order for it to work:** @whyrusleeping @diasdavid @Stebalien (maybe @jbenet)

## Overview

Issue "Make base32 CIDv1 the default for go-ipfs is stalled" (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/4143) in go-ipfs is stalled.  I am not sure the reason but I think part of it is the how to handle CIDv0 (https://github.com/ipfs/go-cid/issues/34).

Having all key players in the same room would be an ideal opportunity to move this forward and work though and outstanding issues.

## Goals

Make decisions on if we want to switch to base32 and CIDv0 will be handled after the switch.
