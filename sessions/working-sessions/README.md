# Small Team Working Sessions

This is a variant on the [poster-making sessions](../poster-making) that @diasdavid proposed. Rather than having people document something in a poster, let them work together in small teams to tackle a work package using techniques like pair programming.

- **Duration** 60 minutes (or 90 minutes?)
- **Who Should Attend:** Anyone who wants to work on a work package with a small group  
- **Who has to be there in order for it to work:** Many of the work packages involve knowledge from the maintainer who has worked on it the most. We will have to do some advance planning to match people with work packages in a way that will work.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Tackle known issues that will benefit from people doing synchronous work on them.  
- **Activity:** In pairs or trios, spend 75 minutes unpacking a work package together, designing solutions, pair programming, etc, then report back on the work you accomplished.
- **Outcomes:** Make progress on important work packages and build people's working relationships.

# Proposed Deep Dive Sessions

If you want to propose a working session, add it here (via a Pull Request). Optionally use the [template](../_template.md) to provide a fuller description of the session.

Note: Ideally the teams for the various working sessions should be formed before everyone arrives in Berlin so we can optimize the schedule.

| Objective | Proposed by | Necessary Participants | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| _{specify the objective of the work}_ | _{your name}_ | ??? | _{describe what you want to do in this work session}_
